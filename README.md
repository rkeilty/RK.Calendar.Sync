### RK Calendar Sync
Simple calendar sync application, with the capability to sync multiple calendar services with each other.

Right now more of a test bed to give the EWS and Google Calendar API v3 a whirl, since Google's official calendar sync was retired.

### Features
* One way or bi-directional sync
* Adjustable sync ranges

### Supported calendar services
* Google Calendar
* Exchange (2007-2013)

### Simple setup
The application relies on 3 files to be in place and configured, CalendarConfigurations.xml, ServiceConfigurations.xml, and SyncConfigurations.xml.
